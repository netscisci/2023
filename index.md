# Overview

This is the homepage for our [NetSci 2023](https://netsci2023.wixsite.com/netsci2023) workshop on 'Networks in Science of Science', which will be held in Vienna, Austra in July 10-14, 2023.


# Background

The vast amount of research articles, preprints, grant proposals, and patents produced by scientists provide a rich digital trace of the scientific ecosystem. This data is the foundation of an emerging field called the "**Science of Science**", which aims to understand the evolution of science in a quantitative manner. This field has the potential to bring significant benefits in terms of scientific, technological, and educational advancement. Networks are a useful and intuitive tool for understanding the connections between various elements in the scientific community, such as scientists, institutions, journals, conferences, ideas, theories, and funding agencies. 

This satellite workshop invites researchers and practitioners to share their latest findings and developments in the area of **network science applied to the study of science**. This is a particularly exciting time to discuss new studies on rich representations (such as hypergraphs) or new deep-learning-based methods of predicting and understanding. We aim to bring together an **interdisciplinary** group of researchers to reflect the diverse community that can drive (and benefit from) scientific innovation. In addition, this workshop presents an excellent opportunity for more **junior researchers** (such as graduate students, postdocs, and pre-tenure professors) to gain exposure within the field. This will serve as a platform for them to present ongoing research, receive feedback and guidance from more experienced researchers, and network with potential mentors, collaborators, and funders. 

This is a continuation of previous successful workshops and conferences on organized by [members of our PC](https://netscisci.github.io/organizers#program-committee) on Science of Science, both from within and outside NetSci: “International Conference on the Science of Science and Innovation” (2022), “Science of Team Science & Innovation” (NetSci 2022), “Knowledge Networks in Science and Technology” (NetSci 2017), the “Annual International Conference on Computational Social Science” (2015-2022), “International Symposium on the Science of Science” (2016), “Quantifying Science” (Conference on Complex Systems 2015). The success of these workshops is attributed to the continued interest and engagement from the network science community in the study of the Science of Science.
